# Multiple Disease Prediction System

Welcome to the Multiple Disease Prediction System! This end-to-end machine learning project is designed to analyze various medical parameters and predict the likelihood of a patient acquiring a particular disease. With this project, our goal is to assist healthcare providers in identifying potential health risks in their patients and taking preventative measures to mitigate those risks.

## Overview

This project utilizes a variety of machine learning algorithms, including decision trees, random forests, and logistic regression. Additionally, data preprocessing techniques such as feature scaling and feature selection are employed to ensure that the data is clean and ready for analysis. The system aims to achieve a higher accuracy rate in disease prediction, thereby potentially improving healthcare outcomes for patients.

## How to Use

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Select Disease Prediction**: 
   - Start by selecting the desired disease prediction from the sidebar menu. You can choose from:
     - Diabetes Prediction
     - Heart Disease Prediction
     - Parkinson's Disease Prediction
     - Lung Cancer Prediction
     - Hypo-Thyroid Prediction

2. **Input Medical Parameters**:
   - Once you've selected the disease prediction, you will be prompted to input relevant medical parameters. These parameters may vary depending on the selected disease.

3. **View Prediction Result**:
   - After entering the required medical parameters, click the button to view the prediction result. The system will analyze the input parameters and predict the likelihood of the patient having the selected disease.

4. **Interpret Prediction**:
   - The prediction result will be displayed on the screen, indicating whether the person is likely to have the disease or not. Interpret the prediction to assess the patient's health risk.
